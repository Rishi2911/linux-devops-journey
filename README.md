## 📖 Overview  
This repo documents my **first Linux hands-on exercises** where I practiced:  
- 🗂️ File management (`pwd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `cat`, `cp`, `mv`)  
- ⚡ Creating & executing shell scripts (`script.sh`)  
- 🔑 Understanding **permissions** with `ls -l` and `chmod`  

This is part of my **DevOps & Cloud Learn-in-Public Journey**.

## 🎯 Exercises  

### 🔹 Exercise 1 — File Management  
👉 Goal: Learn basic file handling commands in Linux.  

#### 📌 Code I Practiced
```bash
# Show current directory
pwd

# List files
ls

# Create a new folder
mkdir DevOpsPractice

# Enter the folder
cd DevOpsPractice

# Create a new empty file
touch hello.txt

# Write text into the file
echo "My first Linux practice file" > hello.txt

# Read the file
cat hello.txt

# Copy the file
cp hello.txt copy.txt

# Rename/Move the file
mv copy.txt moved.txt
```
#### 📘 What I Learned  

- `pwd` → Print current directory  
- `ls` & `ls -l` → List files with permissions/owners/sizes  
- `touch` → Create empty files  
- `echo >` → Write into files  
- `cp` → Copy files  
- `mv` → Move/rename files
